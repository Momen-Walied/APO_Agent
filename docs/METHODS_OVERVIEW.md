# Methods Overview: ACE Efficiency (6 Tiers)

- __Tier 1 – Caching__: trajectory cache; insight cache; curator cache with fingerprints and staleness.
- __Tier 2 – Model Tiering__: large Generator, medium Reflector, small Curator; quantized locals for non-critical roles.
- __Tier 3 – Adaptive Rounds__: early stopping via insight convergence; severity-based depth.
- __Tier 4 – Context Optimization__: hierarchical bullets; distillation; usefulness-weighted retrieval.
- __Tier 5 – Batching__: reflect N errors at once; curate N insights at once with ID-mapped outputs.
- __Tier 6 – Architecture__: lazy updates on degradation; utility pruning; hybrid short/medium/long-term memory.
